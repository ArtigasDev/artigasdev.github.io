***Andara: Rise for Rebellion*** is a third person shooter based on games like "Rachet & Clank" and "Control", with mechanics that bring speed to the gameplay similar to shooters like "Doom".

# Work Methodology
A multidisciplinary team of 7 programmers, 6 artists, and 3 game designers are working on the development. The progress of the game can be followed on [@AndaraGame](https://twitter.com/AndaraGame).

Our project aims to simulate the work of a video games studio closely. We have set deadlines and milestones, such as the prototype and the first playable version. Our approach is based on the scrum methodology, with weekly sprints that start and end with meetings to review the progress of each department and assess our achievements.

Effective communication is essential for the success any project. We emphasize communication within and between teams. It is vital to keep in constant contact with our fellow designers and artists to ensure the healthy development of the game and improve iteration.

# Story
The game tells the story of Andara, the heir to the throne of an interplanetary alien race led by her father, Ordon. In her attempt to colonise other planets in search of resources, she discovers her father's tyranny first hand, as he is willing to do anything to achieve his goal, including killing Andara's best friend. Andara then begins a revolt to stop her father's tyrannical invasion and save the planet Hailstone.
