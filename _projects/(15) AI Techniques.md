description: A procedural generated terrain using Marching Cubes and Wave Function Collapse.
---

This project aims to create a 3D procedural generated terrain using the Marching Cubes algorithm and populate it with 3D models using Wave Function Collapse. In addition, there will be some entities in the world that will be moving around usign the A* algorithm.

Since the project is still in progress, updates will be made regularly to this page to keep you informed.

# Features in process
- Marching Cubes.
- Wave Function Collapse.
- Perlin Noise.
- A*.

# How it was implemented
Work in progress...<br><br>
