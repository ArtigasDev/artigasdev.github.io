This academic project was developed using pure C and SDL graphic library. The objective was to recreate the **terrain rendering** of the well-known videogame **"Comanche"**, and in a fully optimized way with the aim of reducing the cycle cost for the CPU as much as possible.
<br>In addition, the main function of the program was rewritten in ARM assembly code and tested on a Raspberry PI.
