The project consisted of recreating the classic arcade game Asteroids released in 1979 that involves controlling a spaceship and shooting asteroids and flying saucers while avoiding collisions with them. The game is played in a space setting and features vector graphics that were innovative for the time. The game features original features as increasing difficulty as the player progresses through levels with more and faster asteroids and enemies, and an increasing spawn rate of saucers as fewer asteroids remain.

In addition to the base game, a visual user management system has been implemented with ImGui in which you can log in, register and modify the data of existing users. Each user is assigned various data including the number of credits remaining to play with, and their high score, which will be used to position them on a leaderboard.

# Features:
- Increasing difficulty through levels.
- User management system made with ImGui.
- Ordered leaderboard.
