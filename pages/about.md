# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**, I was born in Zaragoza, Spain and I've been interested in videogames and technology since I was a child. I've always been curious about how videogames are made and how the industry has evolved.

My immersion in the world of programming began with a Higher Level Education Cycle in Multi-platform Application Development (HNC equivalent), where I learned a good programming base and how to approach problems with logical thinking.

In 2020, I began studying at ESAT, where I've been learning about various topics including Git usage, programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, and Kotlin, graphics programming with OpenGL, in-engine programming with Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4 and 5, and skills at optimization and memory management. 

Currently, I'm working on two major projects that are planned to be completed in June 2023. One of them is a videogame engine in C++ that implements features such as graphics rendering with OpenGL, ECS, ImGui, and more. The other project is a third-person shooter videogame developed in Unreal Engine and worked on by a team of 16 people consisting of artists, designers, and other programmers. We are following a development process similar to what can be found in the industry by fulfilling milestones and making use of organisational tools like Trello. The project will be published on Steam and presented at DreamHack Valencia.
