# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**, I was born in Zaragoza, Spain and I've been interested in videogames and technology since I was a child. I've always been curious about how videogames are made and how the industry has evolved.

My immersion in the world of programming began with a Higher Level Education Cycle in Multi-platform Application Development (HNC equivalent), where I learned a good programming base and how to approach problems with logical thinking.

In 2020, I began studying at ESAT, where I've been learning about various topics including Git usage, programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, and Kotlin, graphics programming with OpenGL, in-engine programming with Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4 and 5, and skills at optimization and memory management. 

My most significant achievement to date is the creation of 'Andara: Rise for Rebellion,' a game that was not only presented at Dreamhack Valencia but is also now available on Steam. This project was a significant academic endeavor that brought together a multidisciplinary team consisting of 7 programmers, 6 artists, and 3 game designers.

Our primary goal was to emulate the game development process found in the industry, and we achieved this by setting and meeting specific milestones. We made effective use of organizational tools like Trello and version control software such as Perforce. Our development process involved weekly sprints, each starting and ending with meetings to comprehensively review the progress made by each department and evaluate our overall achievements.
